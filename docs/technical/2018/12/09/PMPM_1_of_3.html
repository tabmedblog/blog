        <p>Per-member per-month (PMPM) calculations are key for healthcare payers. Say that, in a given month, your total payout is $10M in claims and you had 1M members in your plan. Your monthly insurance premium has to be at least $100M / 1M = $100 for you to cover your claim expenses. Add your other costs and you have an indication of what your premiums should be.</p>

<p>PMPM calculations are a way to observe trends, as well as slice and dice healthcare numbers. They allow for a fair comparison across different populations (e.g. the 0-20 year olds vs the 21+ year olds, or the West coast population vs the South population). They can also help identify what contributes to a particular cost, e.g. breakdown the monthly payouts by line of service.</p>

<h1 id="compare-across-member-dimensions">Compare across member dimensions</h1>

<p>Member dimensions are those that slice the member population. Geography is a good example. In California you may have 1M members in your plan while you only have 10K members in North Dakota.</p>

<p>Other member dimensions are time (members come in and out of your plan over time), as well as any dimension that defines a member, such as gender, age, and any flags that characterize a member, e.g. a past diagnosis. All these dimensions come from your membership and member tables.</p>

<p>By calculating measures and dividing them by the number of members concerned, you are able to do a <em>fair comparison</em> of your measure.</p>

<h1 id="compare-across-other-dimensions">Compare across other dimensions</h1>

<p>If you use other dimensions, such as service line, you are now breaking up your measure and are looking at the <em>contribution</em> of a service line towards the overall PMPM value.</p>

<h1 id="calculating-pmpm">Calculating PMPM</h1>

<p>Calculating PMPM numbers always end up being a ratio. Itâ€™s the ratio of your aggregate measure, divided by the number of member-month in your population and timeframe.</p>

</code></pre></div></div>

<p>How we get to this point is the object of parts 2 and 3 of this article.</p>

<h1 id="methods">Methods</h1>

<p>There are essentially two methods to achieve PMPM calculations in Tableau.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Blending</li>
  <li>Data prep + LODs</li>
</ol>

<p>The first method is the natural one. You pull costs from one datasource. You pull MM counts from another datasource. You blend them together.</p>

<p>The second method requires some upfront work. Typically you will have to prep your data, join it in a special way into a single data source, and prepare the MM and measure PMPM calculations upfront. The benefit is that because it becomes a single datasource, it can be published back to Tableau Server and shared with others.</p>
